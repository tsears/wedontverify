_"The best way to chat with everyone you know - and also with people you don't @#^$#!ing know"_

I'm getting tired of people signing up for accounts to websites with my email address, then getting
their email updates!  There is a simple way to fix this, and that's for site developers to _verify
people's email addresses!_. You know, those emails that come when you create an account, and they
ask you to click a link to verify _before_ spamming you with every little update to a social
networking profile? It's time to start calling these shitty sites out.

First on our list is [GroupMe](https://groupme.com/).  According to their site, as of August 2011 
they're "a proud member of the Skype family."  Tsk tsk Microsoft, I expect better from you.


Congratulations on being the inaugural shitty site, GroupMe!
